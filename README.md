# Movie Streaming Platform - Video Selection Guide

## How to Select Videos

### Prerequisites
- You must be the **room host** (creator of the room) to control video playback
- Only hosts can upload videos or add video URLs

### Method 1: Upload Local Video File
1. Look for the **Upload button** (📤 icon) in the video player controls at the bottom
2. Click the upload button
3. Select a video file from your computer (MP4, WebM, etc.)
4. The video will automatically load for all participants

### Method 2: Add Video URL
1. Look for the **Link button** (🔗 icon) in the video player controls at the bottom
2. Click the link button
3. Enter a direct video URL (must be a direct link to MP4, WebM, or other supported formats)
4. Click "Add Video" to load it for all participants

### Video Player Controls (Host Only)
- ▶️ **Play/Pause**: Control playback for all participants
- 🔊 **Volume**: Adjust your local volume
- ⏭️ **Seek**: Click on progress bar to jump to specific time
- 📤 **Upload**: Add local video files
- 🔗 **URL**: Add videos from web URLs
- ⛶ **Fullscreen**: Enter fullscreen mode

### Supported Video Formats
- MP4 (recommended)
- WebM
- OGV
- Any format supported by HTML5 video element

### Example Video URLs for Testing
You can test with these sample video URLs:
- `https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4`
- `https://sample-videos.com/zip/10/mp4/SampleVideo_1280x720_1mb.mp4`

### Troubleshooting
- **"No video selected" message**: Only the room host can add videos
- **Video won't load**: Ensure the URL is a direct link to a video file
- **Controls disabled**: You're not the host - only hosts can control playback
- **Sync issues**: Host controls automatically sync to all participants

### Room Roles
- **Host** (👑): Can upload videos, control playback, manage room
- **Participant**: Can watch, chat, and see other participants' cameras

## Getting Started
1. Create a room to become the host
2. Share the room code with friends
3. Upload a video or add a video URL
4. Enjoy watching together!
